# Cognitrained | Bridging the Judgment Gap

**Certify the logic behind the prompt.**

Cognitrained is a high-stakes, simulation-based platform designed to train and verify the mental models required for advanced AI-assisted engineering. We don't teach tool-usage; we rewire how engineers think, delegate, and audit in an AI-accelerated world.

## 🏛 The Mission: The Judgment Gap
In the industry today, there is a widening **Judgment Gap**—the difference between "getting code from AI" and "shipping production-grade systems with AI." Cognitrained exists to bridge this gap through **Adversarial Auditing** and **Hardcore Cognitive Rewiring**.

### The Cognitive Loop (Rubric)
1. **Definition**: Precision and atomicity of intent.
2. **Delegation**: Decomposition depth and context anchoring.
3. **Dialogue**: Signal vs. Noise management during iterations.
4. **Defense**: Validation rigor and adversarial testing.

## 📜 Principles of Development
1. **Rigor over Speed**: Every UI element must feel institutional and high-stakes.
2. **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Geometric typography, sharp borders, and theme-aware branding.
3. **Adversarial Design**: The platform itself must challenge the user's assumptions at every turn.
